🚀 Exploration Crusader

Exploration Crusader** is a web-based 2D space adventure game built using HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript. Players control a spaceship to collect meteor samples while avoiding obstacles like black holes and space poles. The goal is to stay alive and score as many points as possible.

This project showcases my front-end development skills, understanding of game loops and collision mechanics, and my ability to build polished, interactive user experiences with raw web technologies.

 💡 What I Learned

This project helped me grow significantly as a developer. Some of my biggest takeaways:

- Switched from **bounding box to circular collision detection** for better accuracy
- Solved a major bug with **background scrolling glitches** by using a dual-image system
- Learned to prioritize **core gameplay mechanics** over extra features when under time constraints
- Improved my understanding of **game loops**, **state management**, and **responsive design**

 🧩 Challenges I Solved

- Collision detection: Early hitboxes felt unfair — fixed using the Euclidean distance formula
- Background glitches: Solved jumping by scrolling two images together
- Scope creep: Focused on polish and core functionality instead of overloading features
